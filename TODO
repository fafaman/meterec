BUG
- OVR record mode seams to need lock to perform properly. observed bounce in audio recorded without lock...
x failure to read configuration file breaks jackd
- meter goes over 0db limit (by 1 char)
- live update of the locks is not immediate somtimes
- seams cracks in audio breaks jackd (may not be linked to meterec)
- sometimes need to hit return twice to start recording
x Exiting on error should properly close ncurses window...
x problem with "not take yet" information
x port map trailing spaces
x missing index a end of line when saving session/setup
x record mode broken in 0.5 - the n_takes was updated too often in load_setup()

FEATURES
- should rework buffer handling to start over immediately on playback and record. (maybe pre-fill read-buffer)
- add a way to detect clicks (saturation)
- integrate a tuner (use tuneit or lingot) with a single key to select what port to tune
- toggle pass tru (using jack conection) on a keystroke, this is to avoid larsen when playback 
- toggle pass tru (using hw monitor) - see what "use HW mon" of jackd does.
- center meterec in the console verticaly, this is not to be bothered by bad/misstuned screens not dsiplqying whole console
- center meterec in the console horizontaly...
x Option to produce in stdout template file based on system...
x Add creation of empty session file if file does not exists.
- Add support for compensating internal delays ( move initial position of process read buf pos)
- Beware on internal timing compensation for overdub mode ( nunless overdub is a dub + extra connection - bof, will record twice the new take)
- free all alooacated memory before leaving
x colorise meters that will be recorded
x Add ncurse support
x remove decibel mode
x implement Overdub mode
x replace P with X
x Use .conf file only for setting up number of ports + connections
x .sess file ony to register the track mapping
x Add playback level meter
x Add portmap file for handling connections to system/ports
x Change take file name to be sessionname_xxx.wav
x Modify Record mode not to play
x Add overdub mode
x Add dub mode
x support case unsensitive in .conf
